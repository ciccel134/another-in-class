            <h2>Two Violent Uncles Cooking to the Beat </h2>
            <h4>A Short Story by Rita Reader</h4>
            <p>
                Chris Smith had always hated wild Berlin with its ordinary, old oceans. It was a place where he felt shocked.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                He was a rude, smart, wine drinker with tall legs and hairy fingers. His friends saw him as a careful, curly coward. Once, he had even saved a keen baby bird that was stuck in a drain. That's the sort of man he was.
            </p>

            <p>
                Chris walked over to the window and reflected on his noisy surroundings. The hail pounded like chatting badgers.
            </p>

            <p>
                Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Maud Malkovich. Maud was a creepy lawyer with moist legs and ginger fingers.
            </p>

            <p>
                Chris gulped. He was not prepared for Maud.
            </p>

            <p>As Chris stepped outside and Maud came closer, he could see the stupid smile on her face.</p>
        
            <p>"I am here because I want some more Twitter followers," Maud bellowed, in a loving tone. She slammed her fist against Chris's chest, with the force of 5879 giraffes. "I frigging love you, Chris Smith."</p> 

            <p>Chris looked back, even more sparkly and still fingering the bendy kettle. "Maud, oh my God they killed Kenny," he replied.</p>

            <p>They looked at each other with sleepy feelings, like two knowledgeable, knotty koalas running at a very gracious funeral, which had indie music playing in the background and two violent uncles cooking to the beat.</p>

            <p>Chris regarded Maud's moist legs and ginger fingers. He held out his hand. "Let's not fight," he whispered, gently.</p>

            <p>"Hmph," pondered Maud.</p>

            <p>"Please?" begged Chris with puppy dog eyes.</p>

            <p>Maud looked delighted, her body blushing like a bright, bumpy banana.</p>

            <p>Then Maud came inside for a nice glass of wine.</p>

            THE END <br />

            </p>

            <h5>HELP PLS</h5>
            <p>

            </p>
